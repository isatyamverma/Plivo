# Plivo

1. I am using django and tried not to use much of the framework constructs except boiler plates.
2. Mainly code is written in following files in same order:
   * contactapp/views.py
   * core/resources.py
   * contactapp/serializers.py
   * core/tests.py
   * contactapp/tests.py
   * contactapp/models.py (ORM) <= Tables
   * core/models.py (ORM) <= Tables
